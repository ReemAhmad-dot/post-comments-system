    now you should be familiar with the Auth::user() method for JWT authentication.
    It returns the currently authenticated user using the default guard.
    Considering you’re using a non-default guard, you’ll have to use the Auth::guard() method to specify its name.
    However, if you’ve configured the api guard as default,
    you can skip the call to the Auth::guard() method and write Auth::user() instead.**/
